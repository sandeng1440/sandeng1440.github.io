These functions are available in all languages that encourage functional programming at the language level i.e Haskell as well as the multi-purpose languages such as Python and Javascript. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how they work and implement them in Golang. Golang is not a functional programming language, but it gives us the tools to perform functional programming with the generics.\nMap # The map function is the first in the holy trinity of functional programming. The function Map(iterable, f) takes a function f, known as a transform function, and applies it to every element of the iterable (array, list, tuple, set). In our case, we\u0026rsquo;ll apply it to a slice of type T (generic type).\n// Simple map function that transforms a slice func Map[T any](slice []T, transform func(T) T) []T { result := make([]T, len(slice)) for _, elem := range slice { // index is ignored result = append(result, transform(elem)) // transform every element and append it to result } return result } Filter # The filter function is the second in the holy trinity of functional programming. The function Filter(iterable, f) takes an iterable and returns all the elements that make the function f return true.\nfunc Filter[T any](slice []T, f func(T) bool) []T { var result []T for _, elem := range slice { // ignore index if f(elem) { // if f returns true, then result = append(result, elem) // append the elem to the result } } return result } Reduce # The reduce function is the third function in the holy trinity of functional programming. This function Reduce(iterable, reducer) takes an iterable and applies a function reducer() to reduce the iterable to a single value accumulator that represents the iterable. The reduce function takes advantage of a closure to keep track of the current value of the accumulator as it iterates through the iterable. The reducer function has this signature: reducer(accumulator, elem) where elem is the current element in the iterable that is to be reduced into the accumulator.\nfunc Reduce[T any](slice []T, reducer func(T, T) T) T { var accumulator T for i, elem := range slice { if i == 0 { accumulator = elem } else { accumulator = reducer(accumulator, elem) } } return accumulator } ","date":"3 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/map-filter-reduce/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Map, Filter \u0026 Reduce","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Santiago Deng's Blog","summary":"","title":"Santiago Deng's Blog","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"3 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"My name is Santiago Deng, I\u0026rsquo;m a student at the KCA University.
